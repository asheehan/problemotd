Unique Permutations
Today's problem comes from @mofodox.

Given the string "Hello world hello" how many unique (case sensitive) permutations can you find?

Solution: 
17 characters total (counting spaces)
E repeats twice
L repeats 5 times
O repeats 3 times
space repeats twice

(H and h are different given the rules)

17! / (2! * 5! * 3! * 2!)
= 123502579200
